#Simplicial Complex based Point Correspondence between Images warped onto Manifolds
This is a source code of paper titled "Simplicial Complex based Point Correspondence between Images warped onto Manifolds" accepted at ECCV 2020. This solves assignment problem using higher order structures between images warped onto manifolds.

Code is developed in MATLAB R2017b

#Usage
1. To run end to end matching model to generate results for "Desktop" dataset, do the following:
```
end2end.m
```
2. To reproduce results mentioned in the main paper, do the following:
```
main.m
```
This will generate results for our method (our_spherical, our_conical and our_ellipsoidal) presented in Table 2 and 3 in main paper. The results would be generated in the output files.
